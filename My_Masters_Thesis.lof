\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces A fluorescence microscope uses a light source to excite fluorescent molecules in a sample. The emitted light is then filtered and focused to create an image. The image shows a diagram of a fluorescence microscope. The light source is a mercury lamp, which emits a broad spectrum of light. The excitation filter only allows light of a certain wavelength to pass through. The dichroic mirror reflects the excitation light away and allows the fluorescent light to pass through. The emission filter only allows light of a certain wavelength to pass through. The objective lens focuses the fluorescent light onto the detector, which converts it into an image. \cite {File:Fluorescence Microscopy 01.png - Biology Wiki}\relax }}{4}{figure.caption.5}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3}{\ignorespaces Schematic representation of the ICS optical and flow hardware components, showing the excitation and emission beam paths. The excitation beam path utilizes acousto-optic deflectors (AOD) to split a single laser beam into an array of beamlets with different optical frequencies and angles. Another AOD adjusts the optical frequency of a reference beam, which overlaps with the beamlet array. These overlapping beams intersect the flow cell (FC) of a cuvette sorter. The emission beam path involves generating images from digitized signals, including light loss, forward scatter (FSC), side scatter (SSC), and four fluorescent channels. Example images demonstrate the labeling of HeLa cells expressing GalNAcT2-green fluorescent protein (GFP) with CD147 PE-CF594 and DRAQ5 nuclear dye. Grayscale images display FSC, SSC, and light loss. The components used include beam splitter (BS), mirror (M), objective (Obj), deflection plates (DP), obscuration bar (OB), pinhole (P), lens (L), band pass (BP), photomultiplier tube (PMT), and photodiode (PD).

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4}{\ignorespaces Overview of the ICS low-latency data-processing pipeline, highlighting the steps involved. Photodetectors generate pulses with high-frequency modulations that encode the image waveform. Fourier analysis is employed to reconstruct the image from the modulated pulse. An image-processing pipeline extracts image features, while a pulse-processing pipeline derives additional features from the pulse. Real-time sort classification electronics utilize these features to classify particles and make sort decisions. The resulting sort decision is used to selectively charge the droplets, as indicated by the dotted gray line in panel A \cite {doi:10.1126/science.abj3013}.\relax }}{7}{figure.caption.7}%

Representative images of each organelle are displayed, while the complete datasets comprising 10,000 images each can be accessed as detailed in the data and materials availability section. The following dyes or protein fusions were utilized: cell membrane (Cellmask dye), cytoplasm (GFP fused to HIV Rev nuclear export sequence), mitochondria (Mitotracker dye), nucleus (H2B-mNG), Golgi apparatus (GalNAcT2-GFP), endoplasmic reticulum (ER, ERtracker dye), nucleolus (eGFP-Ki-67), nuclear envelope (LamB1-GFP), P bodies (eGFP-DDX6), Cajal bodies (eGFP-COIL), and centrosomes (anti-pericentrin antibody). P bodies and Cajal bodies were observed in fixed cells, while centrosomes were imaged in fixed and metaphase-stalled cells, resulting in reduced contrast in the light loss (LL) image.
