abstract = {Abstract Cell separation is broadly useful for applications in clinical diagnostics, biological research, and potentially regenerative medicine. Recent attention has been paid to label-free size-based techniques that may avoid the costs or clogging issues associated with centrifugation and mechanical filtration. We present for the first time a massively parallel microfluidic device that passively separates pathogenic bacteria cells from diluted blood with macroscale performance. The device was designed to process large sample volumes in a high-throughput, continuous manner using 40 single microchannels placed in a radial array with one inlet and two rings of outlets. Each single channel consists of a short focusing, gradual expansion and collection region and uses unique differential transit times due to size-dependent inertial lift forces as a method of cell separation. The gradual channel expansion region is shown to manipulate cell equilibrium positions close to the microchannel walls, critical for higher efficiency collection. We demonstrate >80\% removal of pathogenic bacteria from blood after two passes of the single channel system. The massively parallel device can process 240 mL/h with a throughput of 400 million cells/min. We expect that this parallelizable, robust, and label-free approach would be useful for filtration of blood as well as for other cell separation and concentration applications from large volume samples.

abstract = {Fast and selective isolation of single cells with unique spatial and morphological traits remains a technical challenge. Here, we address this by establishing high-speed image-enabled cell sorting (ICS), which records multicolor fluorescence images and sorts cells based on measurements from image data at speeds up to 15,000 events per second. We show that ICS quantifies cell morphology and localization of labeled proteins and increases the resolution of cell cycle analyses by separating mitotic stages. We combine ICS with CRISPR-pooled screens to identify regulators of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway, enabling the completion of genome-wide image-based screens in about 9 hours of run time. By assessing complex cellular phenotypes, ICS substantially expands the phenotypic space accessible to cell-sorting applications and pooled genetic screening. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting, reported in Science 52 years ago, has revolutionized biomedical research, giving us the ability to isolate cells according to the expression of labeled proteins. So far, however, flow cytometric cell sorting has been blind to spatial processes such as intracellular protein localization, which is traditionally measured using microscopy. Schraivogel et al. combined ultrafast microscopy and image analysis with a flow cytometric cell sorter to unlock spatial phenotypes for high-throughput sorting applications. The authors show how this technology can be used to rapidly isolate cells with complex cellular phenotypes and how it can accelerate genome-wide microscopy-based CRISPR screening. —DJ A high-speed cell sorter uses fluorescence imaging to enable genome-scale studies of complex phenotypes of cultured human HeLa cells.}}

ABSTRACT={Modern cytometry technologies present opportunities to profile the immune system at a single-cell resolution with more than 50 protein markers, and have been widely used in both research and clinical settings. The number of publicly available cytometry datasets is growing. However, the analysis of cytometry data remains a bottleneck due to its high dimensionality, large cell numbers, and heterogeneity between datasets. Machine learning techniques are well suited to analyze complex cytometry data and have been used in multiple facets of cytometry data analysis, including dimensionality reduction, cell population identification, and sample classification. Here, we review the existing machine learning applications for analyzing cytometry data and highlight the importance of publicly available cytometry data that enable researchers to develop and validate machine learning methods.}

abstract = {A large-scale and well-annotated dataset is a key factor for the success of deep learning in medical image analysis. However, assembling such large annotations is very challenging, especially for histopathological images with unique characteristics (e.g., gigapixel image size, multiple cancer types, and wide staining variations). To alleviate this issue, self-supervised learning (SSL) could be a promising solution that relies only on unlabeled data to generate informative representations and generalizes well to various downstream tasks even with limited annotations. In this work, we propose a novel SSL strategy called semantically-relevant contrastive learning (SRCL), which compares relevance between instances to mine more positive pairs. Compared to the two views from an instance in traditional contrastive learning, our SRCL aligns multiple positive instances with similar visual concepts, which increases the diversity of positives and then results in more informative representations. We employ a hybrid model (CTransPath) as the backbone, which is designed by integrating a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a multi-scale Swin Transformer architecture. The CTransPath is pretrained on massively unlabeled histopathological images that could serve as a collaborative local–global feature extractor to learn universal feature representations more suitable for tasks in the histopathology image domain. The effectiveness of our SRCL-pretrained CTransPath is investigated on five types of downstream tasks (patch retrieval, patch classification, weakly-supervised whole-slide image classification, mitosis detection, and colorectal adenocarcinoma gland segmentation), covering nine public datasets. The results show that our SRCL-based visual representations not only achieve state-of-the-art performance in each dataset, but are also more robust and transferable than other SSL methods and ImageNet pretraining (both supervised and self-supervised methods). Our code and pretrained model are available at https://github.com/Xiyue-Wang/TransPath.}

abstract = {Principal Components Analysis (PCA) as a method of multivariate statistics was created before the Second World War. However, the wider application of this method only occurred in the 1960s, during the “Quantitative Revolution” in the Natural and Social Sciences. The main reason for this time-lag was the huge difficulty posed by calculations involving this method. Only with the advent and development of computers did the almost unlimited application of multivariate statistical methods, including principal components, become possible. At the same time, requirements arose for precise numerical methods concerning, among other things, the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, because the application of principal components to technical problems required absolute accuracy. On the other hand, numerous applications in Social Sciences gave rise to a significant increase in the ability to interpret these nonobservable variables, which is just what the principal components are. In the application of principal components, the problem is not only to do with their formal properties but above all, their empirical origins. The authors considered these two tendencies during the creation of the program for principal components. This program—entitled PCA—accompanies this paper. It analyzes consecutively, matrices of variance-covariance and correlations, and performs the following functions: •- the determination of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices.•- the testing of principal components.•- the calculation of coefficients of determination between selected components and the initial variables, and the testing of these coefficients,•- the determination of the share of variation of all the initial variables in the variation of particular components,•- construction of a dendrite for the initial set of variables,•- the construction of a dendrite for a selected pattern of the principal components,•- the scatter of the objects studied in a selected coordinate system. Thus, the PCA program performs many more functions especially in testing and graphics, than PCA programs in conventional statistical packages. Included in this paper are a theoretical description of principal components, the basic rules for their interpretation and also statistical testing.}

abstract = {Abstract Cell separation is broadly useful for applications in clinical diagnostics, biological research, and potentially regenerative medicine. Recent attention has been paid to label-free size-based techniques that may avoid the costs or clogging issues associated with centrifugation and mechanical filtration. We present for the first time a massively parallel microfluidic device that passively separates pathogenic bacteria cells from diluted blood with macroscale performance. The device was designed to process large sample volumes in a high-throughput, continuous manner using 40 single microchannels placed in a radial array with one inlet and two rings of outlets. Each single channel consists of a short focusing, gradual expansion and collection region and uses unique differential transit times due to size-dependent inertial lift forces as a method of cell separation. The gradual channel expansion region is shown to manipulate cell equilibrium positions close to the microchannel walls, critical for higher efficiency collection. We demonstrate >80\% removal of pathogenic bacteria from blood after two passes of the single channel system. The massively parallel device can process 240 mL/h with a throughput of 400 million cells/min. We expect that this parallelizable, robust, and label-free approach would be useful for filtration of blood as well as for other cell separation and concentration applications from large volume samples.

abstract = {Fast and selective isolation of single cells with unique spatial and morphological traits remains a technical challenge. Here, we address this by establishing high-speed image-enabled cell sorting (ICS), which records multicolor fluorescence images and sorts cells based on measurements from image data at speeds up to 15,000 events per second. We show that ICS quantifies cell morphology and localization of labeled proteins and increases the resolution of cell cycle analyses by separating mitotic stages. We combine ICS with CRISPR-pooled screens to identify regulators of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway, enabling the completion of genome-wide image-based screens in about 9 hours of run time. By assessing complex cellular phenotypes, ICS substantially expands the phenotypic space accessible to cell-sorting applications and pooled genetic screening. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting, reported in Science 52 years ago, has revolutionized biomedical research, giving us the ability to isolate cells according to the expression of labeled proteins. So far, however, flow cytometric cell sorting has been blind to spatial processes such as intracellular protein localization, which is traditionally measured using microscopy. Schraivogel et al. combined ultrafast microscopy and image analysis with a flow cytometric cell sorter to unlock spatial phenotypes for high-throughput sorting applications. The authors show how this technology can be used to rapidly isolate cells with complex cellular phenotypes and how it can accelerate genome-wide microscopy-based CRISPR screening. —DJ A high-speed cell sorter uses fluorescence imaging to enable genome-scale studies of complex phenotypes of cultured human HeLa cells.}}

ABSTRACT={Modern cytometry technologies present opportunities to profile the immune system at a single-cell resolution with more than 50 protein markers, and have been widely used in both research and clinical settings. The number of publicly available cytometry datasets is growing. However, the analysis of cytometry data remains a bottleneck due to its high dimensionality, large cell numbers, and heterogeneity between datasets. Machine learning techniques are well suited to analyze complex cytometry data and have been used in multiple facets of cytometry data analysis, including dimensionality reduction, cell population identification, and sample classification. Here, we review the existing machine learning applications for analyzing cytometry data and highlight the importance of publicly available cytometry data that enable researchers to develop and validate machine learning methods.}

abstract = {A large-scale and well-annotated dataset is a key factor for the success of deep learning in medical image analysis. However, assembling such large annotations is very challenging, especially for histopathological images with unique characteristics (e.g., gigapixel image size, multiple cancer types, and wide staining variations). To alleviate this issue, self-supervised learning (SSL) could be a promising solution that relies only on unlabeled data to generate informative representations and generalizes well to various downstream tasks even with limited annotations. In this work, we propose a novel SSL strategy called semantically-relevant contrastive learning (SRCL), which compares relevance between instances to mine more positive pairs. Compared to the two views from an instance in traditional contrastive learning, our SRCL aligns multiple positive instances with similar visual concepts, which increases the diversity of positives and then results in more informative representations. We employ a hybrid model (CTransPath) as the backbone, which is designed by integrating a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a multi-scale Swin Transformer architecture. The CTransPath is pretrained on massively unlabeled histopathological images that could serve as a collaborative local–global feature extractor to learn universal feature representations more suitable for tasks in the histopathology image domain. The effectiveness of our SRCL-pretrained CTransPath is investigated on five types of downstream tasks (patch retrieval, patch classification, weakly-supervised whole-slide image classification, mitosis detection, and colorectal adenocarcinoma gland segmentation), covering nine public datasets. The results show that our SRCL-based visual representations not only achieve state-of-the-art performance in each dataset, but are also more robust and transferable than other SSL methods and ImageNet pretraining (both supervised and self-supervised methods). Our code and pretrained model are available at https://github.com/Xiyue-Wang/TransPath.}

abstract = {Principal Components Analysis (PCA) as a method of multivariate statistics was created before the Second World War. However, the wider application of this method only occurred in the 1960s, during the “Quantitative Revolution” in the Natural and Social Sciences. The main reason for this time-lag was the huge difficulty posed by calculations involving this method. Only with the advent and development of computers did the almost unlimited application of multivariate statistical methods, including principal components, become possible. At the same time, requirements arose for precise numerical methods concerning, among other things, the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, because the application of principal components to technical problems required absolute accuracy. On the other hand, numerous applications in Social Sciences gave rise to a significant increase in the ability to interpret these nonobservable variables, which is just what the principal components are. In the application of principal components, the problem is not only to do with their formal properties but above all, their empirical origins. The authors considered these two tendencies during the creation of the program for principal components. This program—entitled PCA—accompanies this paper. It analyzes consecutively, matrices of variance-covariance and correlations, and performs the following functions: •- the determination of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices.•- the testing of principal components.•- the calculation of coefficients of determination between selected components and the initial variables, and the testing of these coefficients,•- the determination of the share of variation of all the initial variables in the variation of particular components,•- construction of a dendrite for the initial set of variables,•- the construction of a dendrite for a selected pattern of the principal components,•- the scatter of the objects studied in a selected coordinate system. Thus, the PCA program performs many more functions especially in testing and graphics, than PCA programs in conventional statistical packages. Included in this paper are a theoretical description of principal components, the basic rules for their interpretation and also statistical testing.}
